The programmer should use all the files in databasess, finally blocked


try:
    statement

except Exceptionname: 
                 statement
finaly:
     statement


Performing the above task is called Exception handling 


# To know the effect of an error
try: 
    print('

should be in material follow


1. Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks.

2. A single try block cn be followed by several exccept blocks 

3. We can not write except blocks  without a try block

4. But we can write try block withot except block.

5. else block is executd only when the ecept blocks are not executed.



Note: we can aslo use else block that means executed when except block i not executed
